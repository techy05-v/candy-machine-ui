Candy Machine User Interface Setup Guide

Introduction:
This guide offers a comprehensive walkthrough for configuring the user interface (UI) of your Candy Machine. The UI is designed to facilitate NFT minting using the SPL token you've generated, with users employing their Phantom wallets for the minting process.

Prerequisites:
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. A configured Candy Machine with specific details in its config.json file, including price, quantity, symbol, seller fee basis points, SPL token account, SPL token, go-live date, and creator details.
2. A Phantom wallet designated for minting.
3. A newly created SPL token.

Steps:

1. SPL Token Setup:
If not already done, create the SPL token following the guidelines outlined in Lesson Three, and take note of the SPL token's address.

2. Update Candy Machine Config:
Edit your Candy Machine's config.json file and update the following fields:

   - splTokenAccount: Replace it with the address of the created SPL token account.
   - splToken: Replace it with the SPL token address.

3. UI Configuration:
Refer to the "Quick Node: Set Up a Minting Site" tutorial for instructions on creating a UI for your Candy Machine. This UI empowers users to connect their Phantom wallets and mint NFTs using the SPL token as payment.

4. Adjust Minting Logic:
Within your SPL project's minting logic (as per Lesson Three), make the necessary modifications to mint NFTs to the Phantom wallet address or adapt the transfer function to deliver minted NFTs to your Phantom wallet.

5. Testing:
Thoroughly test the entire setup by transferring or minting your SPL token to a Phantom account. Utilize the UI to mint NFTs, ensuring a seamless process for users paying in the designated SPL token.
